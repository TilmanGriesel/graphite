# About

Hi there, I'm Tilman, it's great to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a product designer and software engineer with a passion for blending technology, art, and design into thoughtful, open-source projects. I live in a cozy 16th-century home, which I'm gradually transforming into a smarter, more connected space.

## About Graphite

I began designing the Graphite theme in 2022 to make our Home Assistant setup more intuitive and visually harmonious for my partner Sophia and me. My aim was to create a user experience that's both friendly and beautiful, free of unnecessary complexity and compatible without requiring extra plugins.

Graphite was after the first public release crafted with two audiences in mind:

- **Everyday Users**: A clean, out-of-the-box theme that simplifies Home Assistant's interface.
- **Tinkerers**: A flexible foundation for creating custom themes, leveraging build tools and token abstraction to extend or tweak the design effortlessly.

Graphite isn't about flashy features or quantity; it's about quality. It's a theme that grows with you, whether you're just starting out or looking to personalize every pixel of your smart home interface.

## Key Features

- **Minimalist Aesthetic**: A focus on clean design with harmonious colors and device native typography.
- **User-Friendly**: Designed to enhance usability for both new and experienced Home Assistant users.
- **Customization Ready**: Easily extend the theme using the provided tools, or tweak it with the theme patcher.
- **No Dependencies**: No plugins required, Graphite is designed to integrate seamlessly into your setup.

## Why Graphite?

Graphite was born out of a personal need to improve the way we interact with our smart home. I wanted something intuitive, visually appealing, and built to last. It's been a labor of love, evolving through feedback and constant iteration.

If this theme improves your Home Assistant experience, [leaving a star](https://github.com/TilmanGriesel/graphite) on GitHub would mean a lot and help others discover it too!
