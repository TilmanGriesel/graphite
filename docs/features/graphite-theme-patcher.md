## Overview

The Graphite Theme Patcher allows you to:
- Adjust the primary accent color.
- Replace specific theme tokens for deeper customization.

This tool is ideal for tinkerers and power users familiar with script and configuration editing.

::: info
Changes made with this patcher are **temporary**. Updates to the Graphite theme will overwrite customizations unless automated workflows are in place.
:::


## Installation

### **Step 1: Download the Patcher**

Save the `graphite-theme-patcher.py` script to your `/config/scripts` directory. If the directory doesn't exist, create it.

**Quick Command:**

```bash
wget -O /config/scripts/graphite-theme-patcher.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TilmanGriesel/graphite/refs/heads/main/extras/theme-patcher/graphite-theme-patcher.py
```

---

### **Step 2: Add a Shell Command**

1. Open your Home Assistant `configuration.yaml` file.
2. Add the following entry under `shell_command`:

   ```yaml
   shell_command:
     patch_graphite_theme_primary_color: "python3 /config/scripts/graphite-theme-patcher.py {{ rgb_value }}"
   ```

3. Save and restart Home Assistant.


---

### **Step 3: Create a Home Assistant Script**

Use the Home Assistant UI or add this YAML to a new script for adjusting the theme's primary color:

```yaml
alias: Update & Patch Graphite Theme
icon: mdi:palette-swatch
description: Customize the primary color of the Graphite theme.
fields:
  user_primary_color:
    selector:
      color_rgb: {}
    default:
      - 250
      - 154
      - 0
    name: Primary Color
    required: true
    description: Choose your custom primary color (RGB format).
sequence:
  - action: update.install
    target:
      device_id: 510699c015423c5fe6211eccfc3fe364
    data: {}
  - action: shell_command.patch_graphite_theme_primary_color
    data:
      rgb_value: "{{ user_primary_color | join(',') }}"
  - action: frontend.reload_themes
    data: {}

```

## Usage

1. Open the script in Home Assistant.
2. Choose your desired color using the color picker or input RGB values.
3. Run the script to:
   1. Apply your chosen color.
   2. Reload the Graphite theme for immediate updates.

::: info
**Review the script's functionality to ensure safe usage**. While safeguards are in place, it's good practice to understand any changes being applied.

## Advanced Customization

The basic installation outlined earlier will likely meet your needs, so you can stop here if you're satisfied. However, if you're ready to explore the patcher's true potential, consider this your gateway to experimentation and powerful customization. The documentation isn't exhaustive, but it equips you with enough knowledge to dive deep, experimenting with RGB and size tokens to unleash their full power. From here on, you're stepping into experimental, uncharted territory.

```yaml
shell_command:
  patch_theme: "python3 /config/dev/graphite/extras/theme-patcher/graphite-theme-patcher.py --theme {{ theme }} --token {{ token }} --type {{ type }} {{ value }}"

```

Save and restart Home Assistant.
